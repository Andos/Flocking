<h2>Adding and removing boids</h2>

<b>Add object as boid</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Object</b>	-	Which object the Flocking object should take control over<br />
	<b>boid type</b> -	The number identifying the boid-type of the object
</blockquote>
<p>
Makes the Flocking object take control over the object.
The object will move and behave depending on the boid type attributes given for the given boid type.<br />
Note: You cannot add an object twice. A second add is silently ignored.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Remove object</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Object</b>	-	Which object the Flocking object should stop controlling<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Removes the object from the Flocking object's internal list of object it should control.<br />
Note: You don't have to do this before destroying your objects, Flocking object will detect which objects have been destroyed.
</p>

<h2>Setting boid attributes</h2>

<b>Set idle speed</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's idle speed changed<br />
	<b>Speed</b>	-	Decimal speed value. Measured in pixels per time unit.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Changes the idle speed of all the boids with the given boid type number.<br />
The idle speed is the speed a boid will move with when it has nothing else to do.
It functions somewhat the same as the minimum speed, but this value isn't enforced.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Set min speed</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's min speed changed<br />
	<b>Speed</b>	-	Decimal speed value. Measured in pixels per time unit.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Changes the minimum speed of all the boids with the given boid type number.<br />
Note: If the minimum speed is negative it allows the boids to reverse their movement.<br />
Using a negative minimum speed is useful for simulating vehicles reversing their movement before turning towards their destination.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Set max speed</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's max speed changed<br />
	<b>Speed</b>	-	Decimal speed value. Measured in pixels per time unit.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets the maximum speed of all the boids with the given boid type number.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set acceleration</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's acceleration changed<br />
	<b>Acceleration</b>	-	Decimal acceleration value. Measured in change in pixels per time unit.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets the maximum change in speed each time unit while the boids increases their speed.<br />
Note: This value isn't a relative percentage of the max speed
- so if you wish that you must adjust this acceleration to some percentage of your max speed if it changes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set deceleration</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's deceleration changed<br />
	<b>Deceleration</b>	-	Decimal deceleration value. Measured in change in pixels per time unit.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets the maximum change in speed each time unit while the boids decreases their speed.<br />
Note: This value isn't a relative percentage of the max speed
- so if you wish that you must adjust this deceleration to some percentage of your max speed if it changes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set turn speed</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's turn speed changed<br />
	<b>Angular speed</b>	-	Decimal value. Measured in change in angles per time unit.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets the maximum change in a boid's angle each time unit.<br />
Should usually be between [0..180] for any sensible results.
A value of 180 means that it can turn 180 degrees in one instant.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Set view radius</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's view radius changed<br />
	<b>Radius</b>	-	Decimal value. Maximum distance a boid can see.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets the maximum distance the boids can see.<br />
Affects their movement in the sense that they will not move towards other boids
if they are outside the view radius.
<br />
Performance note: The larger the view radius the more CPU power the extension needs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set avoidance radius</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's avoidance radius changed<br />
	<b>Radius</b>	-	Decimal value. The distance when a boid begins to steer clear of others<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets the minimum distance a boid prefers being away from other boids. Kind of a boid "personal space".<br />
Note: The avoidance radius only has an effect if it is smaller than the view radius.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set movement randomization</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's movement randomization changed<br />
	<b>Noise size</b>	-	Decimal value. The larger the value the more jittery the boids will move<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
By default the boids are 100% deterministic; they will always move the same way if the environment is the same.
You can remove this deterministic behavior by setting a small movement randomization value.<br />
It works by applying a random directional force to the boid every frame.
The larger the value the more jittery the boid will become.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set separation weight</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's separation weight changed<br />
	<b>Weight value</b>	-	Decimal value. The larger the value the more the boids will prioritize avoiding each other<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets how much directional force is applied to the boids when they are closer to other boids than their avoidance radius.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set alignment weight</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's alignment weight changed<br />
	<b>Weight value</b>	-	Decimal value. The larger the value the more the boids will prioritize heading the same direction as their flockmates<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets how much a boid prioritizes heading the same direction as their flockmates
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set cohesion weight</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's cohesion weight changed<br />
	<b>Weight value</b>	-	Decimal value. The larger the value the more the boids will prioritize positioning themselves at the average position of their flockmates<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets how much a boid prioritizes positioning themselves at the average position of their flockmates.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<b>Set angle/dir setting</b>
<br />Parameters:
<blockquote>
	<b>Boid type</b>	-	Which boid type should have it's angle/dir setting changed<br />
	<b>Angle/Dir</b>	-	0 = use angles, 1 = use directions<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Sets if the flocking object should change the object's angle or direction value as it moves around.
